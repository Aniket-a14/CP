# 🏆 Competitive Programming (CP)

This repository is my Competitive Programming practice hub where I solve algorithmic and contest-style problems, implement useful templates, and strengthen my problem-solving skills over time.

Competitive programming helps me improve logical thinking, learn advanced algorithms, optimize time/space complexity, and perform well in timed coding environments. This repo reflects that journey.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository is created to:

- Practice problems from contests, online judges, and competitive events  
- Store efficient implementations and reusable templates  
- Track progress in algorithmic problem solving  
- Prepare for competitive coding contests and technical interviews

---

## 💻 Language

All code in this repository is written in **C++**, a language I prefer for its performance, STL support, and competitive programming utility.

---

## 🧠 What You’ll Find Here

- Solutions to competitive problems (diverse difficulty levels)  
- Fast I/O and boilerplate templates  
- Optimized implementations of data structures and algorithms  
- Problem names and tags (wherever possible)

Each solution aims to be clean, efficient, and easy to understand for revisiting later before contests or interviews.

## 📈 My Goals with This Repo

By maintaining this repository, I want to:

- Become faster and more accurate in solving CP problems  
- Learn various algorithmic patterns and advanced concepts  
- Build confidence for competitions and interviews  
- Showcase my CP journey and growth as a programmer
